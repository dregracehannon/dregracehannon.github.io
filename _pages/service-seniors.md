  <div class="service-description">
    <p>The later seasons of life bring their own unique challenges and transitions. Retirement, health changes, loss of loved ones, questions of purpose and legacy, changing family dynamics, and adjusting to new limitations can all contribute to feelings of grief, anxiety, depression, or isolation. These are legitimate struggles that deserve compassionate support.</p>

    <p>With over 30 years of counseling experience, I understand the complexities of aging and the wisdom that comes with a life fully lived. My approach honors your life experience while providing support for the very real challenges you're facing. It's never too late to seek help, find meaning, and experience renewed hope and well-being.</p>

        <h3>Navigating Transitions</h3>
        <p>Late life brings many transitions—retirement, health changes, loss of independence, relocating. I help you process these changes, grieve what's been lost, and find ways to adapt and thrive in your current circumstances.</p>

        <h3>Family Involvement</h3>
