## Understanding Your Mental Health Insurance Benefits

When you're in-network with your health insurance plan, your out-of-pocket costs for therapy are typically much lower. Your specific therapy coverage, copay, coinsurance, and deductible will depend on your individual insurance plan.

I recommend contacting your insurance provider before your first therapy session to verify:
- Your mental health and behavioral health benefits
- Your therapy copay or coinsurance amount
- Whether you need to meet a deductible for counseling services
- If you need a referral or pre-authorization for mental health treatment
