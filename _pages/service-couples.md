  <div class="service-description">
    <p>Every relationship faces challenges. Whether you're dealing with communication breakdowns, trust issues, life transitions, intimacy concerns, or simply feeling disconnected from your partner, couples counseling can help you rediscover the connection that brought you together and build a stronger foundation for your future.</p>

    <p>Relationships require intention, effort, and sometimes outside support to thrive. Seeking couples therapy isn't a sign that your relationship is failing—it's a sign that you both care enough to invest in making it better. My role is to provide a safe, neutral space where both partners feel heard, understood, and supported as we work together toward greater understanding and connection.</p>

        <h3>Impartial Support</h3>
        <p>I'm not here to take sides. My role is to help both partners feel heard, to identify patterns that aren't serving your relationship, and to facilitate healthier communication and connection.</p>

        <h3>Communication Skills</h3>
        <p>Most relationship struggles stem from communication breakdowns. We'll work on developing skills for expressing needs, listening deeply, and understanding each other's perspectives even during conflict.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Patterns</h3>
        <p>Couples often get stuck in negative cycles—the same arguments, the same hurt feelings. We'll identify these patterns and develop new ways of relating that break the cycle and create positive change.</p>

        <p>Beyond resolving conflicts, we'll work on deepening emotional intimacy, rebuilding trust, and strengthening the bond between you—helping you rediscover what brought you together.</p>
