    <p>Trauma doesn't always look like what we see in movies. While some people experience single traumatic events—accidents, assaults, natural disasters—others carry the weight of complex trauma from childhood abuse, neglect, or ongoing traumatic circumstances. Whatever form it takes, trauma can leave lasting imprints on how we see ourselves, others, and the world.</p>

    <p>You might experience flashbacks, nightmares, or intrusive memories. Perhaps you find yourself hypervigilant, easily startled, or constantly on edge. Maybe you avoid people, places, or situations that remind you of the trauma. Or you might feel numb, disconnected from yourself and others, struggling to experience positive emotions. These are all normal responses to abnormal experiences—and they can heal.</p>

        <h3>Safety First</h3>
        <p>Trauma work begins with establishing safety—both in our therapeutic relationship and in your daily life. We'll move at a pace that feels manageable, ensuring you never feel retraumatized in the therapy process.</p>

        <h3>Trauma-Informed Care</h3>
        <p>I understand how trauma affects the brain, body, and nervous system. My approach integrates this knowledge to help you understand your symptoms, develop coping skills, and process traumatic memories safely.</p>

        <i class="fas fa-heart-pulse"></i>
        <h3>Somatic Awareness</h3>
        <p>Trauma lives in the body as much as the mind. We'll work on developing awareness of bodily sensations, learning to regulate your nervous system, and releasing trauma held in the body.</p>

        <h3>Post-Traumatic Growth</h3>
        <p>While trauma changes us, healing is possible. Many people discover new strengths, deeper compassion, and greater resilience through the healing process. You can move beyond survival to thriving.</p>
