    <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
    <p>I believe deeply that we need each other to achieve our best lives and become our authentic selves. Healing, growth, and thriving don't happen in isolation—they unfold through genuine connection and collaboration.</p>

    <h3>Partnership Approach</h3>
    <p>Counseling with me is a partnership. I bring my experience, evidence-based therapeutic approaches, and thoughtful questions; you bring your wisdom about your own life and the courage to explore it honestly.</p>

    <h3>Aha Moments</h3>
    <p>I live for those "aha moments"—when something clicks, when a pattern becomes clear, when you suddenly see a path forward you couldn't see before. Together, we'll work toward the mental health goals that matter most to you.</p>
  </div>

<div class="about-section-simple">
  <h2>What to Expect</h2>
  <p>In our first session, my primary goal is simple: to truly listen. I want to understand what brought you here, what you're carrying, and what you're hoping will be different.</p>
  <p>My hope is that you'll leave our first session feeling two things: <strong>deeply heard</strong> and <strong>genuinely hopeful</strong>.</p>
