Welcome. I'm Dre Grace-Hannon, a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) with over 30 years of experience providing compassionate mental health services to individuals, couples, and families in Texas. Whether you're struggling with anxiety, depression, trauma, relationship challenges, or life transitions, I'm honored you're considering taking this step toward healing and growth.

## Compassionate Therapy Tailored to Your Needs

I believe deeply that we need each other to achieve our best lives and become our authentic selves. Healing, growth, and thriving don't happen in isolation—they unfold through genuine connection and collaboration. As your therapist, I would consider it an honor to be your companion and collaborator during this season of your life.

Counseling with me is a partnership. I bring my experience, evidence-based therapeutic approaches, and thoughtful questions; you bring your wisdom about your own life and the courage to explore it honestly. Together, we'll work toward the mental health goals that matter most to you. I live for those "aha moments"—when something clicks, when a pattern becomes clear, when you suddenly see a path forward you couldn't see before.

## What to Expect

In our first session, my primary goal is simple: to truly listen. I want to understand what brought you here, what you're carrying, and what you're hoping will be different. My hope is that you'll leave our first session feeling two things: deeply heard and genuinely hopeful.

## Experienced Texas LPC with 30+ Years of Practice

I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Texas and completed my Master of Education (M.Ed.) at West Texas A&M University. With 31 years as a licensed professional counselor in Texas, I bring both deep expertise and genuine compassion to every therapeutic relationship.

### Evidence-Based Therapeutic Approaches

My counseling style is warm, solution-oriented, and empowering. I specialize in treating anxiety disorders, depression, trauma and PTSD, relationship issues, and grief. I draw from evidence-based methods including:

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** for anxiety and depression treatment
- **Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)** for relationship issues and life transitions
- **Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT)** for goal-oriented counseling
- **Trauma-Informed Care** for PTSD and trauma recovery

Each therapy approach is tailored to your unique needs and mental health goals.
