  <div class="service-description">
    <p>All relationships require work, and sometimes that work means getting help from someone outside the relationship who can offer perspective, tools, and support. Whether you're considering marriage and want to build a strong foundation, navigating a rough patch, or feeling like you've lost the connection you once had, couples therapy can help you rediscover each other and create the relationship you both want.</p>

    <p>Therapy isn't just for relationships in crisis. Many couples seek counseling proactively—before getting married, after having children, during major life transitions, or simply to tune up their relationship and prevent small issues from becoming bigger problems. Investing in your relationship is one of the wisest decisions you can make.</p>

        <h3>Improving Communication</h3>
        <p>Most relationship struggles involve communication breakdowns. I'll teach you practical skills for expressing your needs, listening with empathy, and having difficult conversations without escalating into destructive conflict.</p>

        <h3>Deepening Emotional Connection</h3>
        <p>Beyond resolving conflicts, we'll focus on rebuilding emotional intimacy, understanding each other's attachment needs, and creating positive cycles of connection that strengthen your bond.</p>

        <h3>Breaking Negative Cycles</h3>
        <p>Couples often get stuck in destructive patterns—the same arguments, the same hurt feelings, the same disconnection. We'll identify these cycles and develop new patterns that promote healing and growth.</p>

        <h3>Creating Shared Vision</h3>
