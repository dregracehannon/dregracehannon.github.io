  <div class="service-description">
    <p>Adult life brings complexity. Career pressures, relationship challenges, family responsibilities, health concerns, and the weight of past experiences can all contribute to feelings of anxiety, depression, overwhelm, or simply being stuck. You might be facing a specific crisis, navigating a major life transition, or dealing with longstanding patterns that no longer serve you.</p>

    <p>Therapy provides a confidential space to explore what's really going on beneath the surface, to process difficult experiences, and to develop new ways of thinking, feeling, and being in the world. Whether you're facing a crisis or simply feeling like something needs to change, I'm here to walk alongside you on this journey of healing and growth.</p>

    <h2>Therapeutic Approach for Adult Counseling</h2>

        <h3>Personalized Treatment</h3>
        <p>Every person's story is unique. I tailor my therapeutic approach to your specific needs, goals, and circumstances rather than applying a one-size-fits-all method.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="approach-tile">
        <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
        <h3>Insight-Oriented Therapy</h3>
        <p>Understanding the roots of our patterns—how our past experiences shape our present responses—can be profoundly liberating. We'll explore these connections to help you make conscious choices rather than automatic reactions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="approach-tile">
        <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
        <h3>Practical Skill Building</h3>
        <p>Insight alone isn't always enough. I provide concrete, evidence-based tools and strategies for managing anxiety, depression, difficult emotions, and challenging life circumstances.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="approach-tile">
        <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>
        <h3>Relational Healing</h3>
        <p>The therapeutic relationship itself is a powerful vehicle for healing. Through our work together, you can experience being genuinely heard, understood, and accepted—often a corrective experience in itself.</p>
