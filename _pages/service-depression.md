  <div class="service-description">
    <p>Depression is more than just feeling sad or having a bad day. It's a persistent heaviness that affects how you think, feel, and function. You might experience loss of interest in things you once enjoyed, constant fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, or even thoughts of death. Depression makes everything feel harder—getting out of bed, going to work, connecting with loved ones, taking care of yourself.</p>

    <p>Depression is not a character flaw or something you can simply "snap out of." It's a legitimate mental health condition that responds to treatment. With the right support, therapeutic approaches, and sometimes collaboration with medical providers, recovery is absolutely possible. You can feel better.</p>

        <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h3>
        <p>CBT helps identify and change the negative thought patterns that fuel depression. We'll work on developing more balanced, realistic ways of thinking that support emotional healing and well-being.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="approach-tile">
        <i class="fas fa-users"></i>
        <h3>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</h3>
        <p>Depression often involves relationship struggles or life transitions. IPT focuses on improving relationships, processing grief and loss, navigating role transitions, and addressing interpersonal conflicts.</p>

      <div class="approach-tile">
        <i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart"></i>
        <h3>Compassionate Support</h3>
        <p>Depression can bring intense shame and self-criticism. I provide a safe, non-judgmental space where you can be honest about your struggles and experience genuine understanding and compassion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="approach-tile">
        <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i>
        <h3>Behavioral Activation</h3>
        <p>Depression saps motivation and energy, creating a cycle of inactivity that worsens mood. We'll work on gradually reintroducing meaningful activities and building momentum toward feeling better.</p>
