  <div class="service-description">
    <p>Adolescence is a time of profound change—physically, emotionally, and socially. The teenage years bring unique challenges: identity formation, peer pressure, academic stress, social media pressures, and the complex task of figuring out who you are and who you want to become. When anxiety, depression, or other struggles emerge during this critical developmental period, having the right support can make all the difference.</p>

    <p>I provide a safe, non-judgmental space where teens can explore their feelings, develop healthy coping strategies, and build resilience. My approach respects the autonomy of young people while providing the guidance and structure they need to navigate this challenging season of life.</p>

        <h3>Teen-Centered Therapy</h3>
        <p>I meet teens where they are, using language and concepts that resonate with their experience. Therapy isn't about lecturing—it's about listening, understanding, and collaborating on solutions that actually work in a teenager's life.</p>

        <i class="fas fa-brain"></i>
        <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Techniques</h3>
        <p>CBT is particularly effective for teens dealing with anxiety and depression. We work together to identify unhelpful thought patterns and develop practical skills for managing difficult emotions and challenging situations.</p>

        <h3>Family Involvement When Helpful</h3>
        <p>While teen therapy is confidential and teen-focused, I believe in involving parents/caregivers in ways that support the therapeutic goals. We'll work together to determine the right level of family involvement for your situation.</p>

        <h3>Strength-Based Approach</h3>
        <p>Teenagers have incredible strengths and resilience. My approach focuses on building on existing strengths while developing new skills and coping strategies for the challenges they face.</p>
