  <div class="service-description">
    <p>Grief is love with nowhere to go. When we lose someone or something deeply important to us—a loved one, a relationship, our health, a job, a dream—the pain can feel unbearable. Grief isn't just sadness; it's a complex mix of emotions: anger, guilt, confusion, relief, numbness, yearning, even moments of unexpected joy or laughter that then bring guilt.</p>

    <p>There's no "right" way to grieve, no timeline you should follow, and no expectation that you'll ever "get over" significant losses. Grief counseling isn't about moving on or forgetting—it's about learning to carry your loss in a way that allows you to live fully again. It's about honoring what you've lost while finding ways to integrate that loss into your continuing life story.</p>

        <h3>Meaning-Making</h3>
        <p>Part of grief work involves making meaning of your loss, finding ways to maintain connection to what you've lost, and discovering how to carry your loss forward in ways that honor both the pain and the love.</p>

        <p>When you're ready, we'll work on gradually rebuilding your life around the loss—not replacing what's gone, but finding new sources of meaning, connection, and purpose as you continue your journey.</p>
